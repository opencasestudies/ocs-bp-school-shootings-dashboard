**What is the purpose of this dashboard?**

This dashboard has two purposes:

1. To Illustrate trends in school shooting events in the United States
2. To demonstrate how to create a dashboard using `R`


This dashboard uses data from the open-source [K-12 Shool Shooting Database](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/) downloaded from the [Center for Homeland Defense and Security](https://www.chds.us/c/) at the at the [Naval Postgraduate School(NPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Postgraduate_School). This data was downloaded in June of 2020.


Riedman, David, and Desmond O’Neill. “CHDS – K-12 School Shooting Database.” Center for Homeland Defense and Security, June 2020, [www.chds.us/ssdb](www.chds.us/ssdb).


This database includes information about school shooting events for students in grades K-12 in the United States dating back to 1970. The database has additional information not shown on our dashboard including but not limited to: 

* Location of the event at the school  
* If the event occured during a sporting event  
* Time of day of the event  
* Day of the week of the event  
* Source for the shooting information  
* If the event was pre-planned or not  
* Shooter's actions immediately following the shooting  
* Shooter characteristics (affiliation with the school, if they had accomplices, if they took hostages, and their age and race)  
* Victom characteristics (afficliation with the school, if they were targeted, their age and race)  

According to the [K-12 Shool Shooting Database](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/) website:

> The School Shooting Database Project is conducted as part of the [Advanced Thinking in Homeland Security (HSx)](https://www.chds.us/c/academic-programs/hsx/) program at the Naval Postgraduate School’s [Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS)](Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS).

> The database compiles information from more than 25 different sources including peer-reviewed studies, government reports, mainstream media, non-profits, private websites, blogs, and crowd-sourced lists that have been analyzed, filtered, deconflicted, and cross-referenced. All of the information is based on open-source information and 3rd party reporting.

> "This database was developed from open-source information and may include reporting errors."

**Want to learn how to create a dashboard just like this?**

Visit the [*Tutorial*](#tutorial) page of this dashboard to first learn the basics about building a dashboard with the `flexdashboard` package.

At the end of the tutorial we provide a link to this [supplementary resource by the Open Case Studies project](INCLUDE LINK HERE), which provides more detailed information about how ***this dashboard*** was created.

We have also included the source code (see upper right-hand corner) in this dashboard for more experienced `R` users looking to mimic some of what we did in this dashboard in their own.

**Disclaimer**

The purpose of the [Open Case Studies](https://opencasestudies.github.io){target="_blank"} project is **to demonstrate the use of various data science methods, tools, and software in the context of messy, real-world data**.

A given case study does not cover all aspects of the research process, is not claiming to be the most appropriate way to analyze a given data set, and should not be used in the context of making policy decisions without external consultation from scientific experts. 

We are simply using data from the [K-12 Shool Shooting Database](https://www.chds.us/ssdb/dataset/), we did not create this database. We acknowlege (like their website) that there may be reporting errors in this database.

Tutorial {.storyboard data-icon="fa-list-ol"}
=========================================   

### **1)** Load the `flexdashboard` package.

Install the package (and other supporting optional packages) if you don't have them installed already.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexdashboard")
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("leaflet")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Once installed, load the package(s) into the `R` environment.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(flexdashboard)
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
library(ggplot2)
```

This all needs to be done separately in the `R` console.

### **2)** Create an `RMD` document.   

Dashboards can be created with `flexdashboard` in the `HTML` format. 

The`flexdashboard` package uses `RMarkdown` to produce dashboards that can contain `R` output.

This makes it possible to include several mediums in dashboards such as plots created with `ggplot2` or maps created with `leaflet`.
    
### **3)** Create an appropriate `YAML`.

The use of `flexdashboard` alters the way R Markdown documents function. 

R Markdown documents can be rendered into many different outputs, one of which is a dashboard. 
The `YAML` header sets up how the document output should be created.

Here is an example of a `YAML` header that creates an `HTML` document from an R Markdown document:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "John Smith"
date: "8/12/2020"
output: html_document
---
```

We used the following `YAML` for this dashboard, which impotantly includes `flexdahsboard::flex_dashboard`which specifies that a dashboard should be created and `runtime:shiny` which allows for the dashboard to be interactive:

```
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    logo: https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/icons8/windows-8/48/Programming-Dashboard-icon.png
    theme: readable
    orientation: columns
    source_code: embed
    vertical_layout: fill
runtime: shiny
```

We also introduced an icon as a logo, provided a theme with a color scheme, defined the orientation (and thus order) of coded output, added a navigation bar item to give users easy access to the code used, and  limited scrolling with the `verticle_layout: fill` option.

### **4)** Design the layout of the dashboard.

Dashboards are inherently visual, making this step the most time intensive after content creation. To goal is to present the data in a way that is both meaningingful and visually appealing.

On this dashboard, we wanted to present static plots of the United States and of individual states. We also wanted to display the locations of school shootings and provide some information about school shootings. Aside from being a dashboard, we wanted to create an educational resource that was reproducible for others. Lastly, as this is a sensitive topic, we wanted to raise awareness and provide information that could help others act.

Given these goals, we decided on the following page layout:

+ About
+ The Data
+ US Statistics
+ State Statistics
+ Map
+ Tutorial
+ Hotline

The first page gives users to the opportunity to look at the data themselves. More complicated components such as the map of each incident were left alone on a single page. US and state-level statistics were separated from one another. This short tutorial on how to create the dashboard and source code were included in the dashboard with programmers at all levels in mind.

### **5)** Add content to the dashboard.

You can begin adding content to the dashboard once you have an initial layout in mind. Keep in mind that this will likely be an iterative process. 

The R Markdown file used to create a dashboard with `flexdashboard` works similarly as it does in other cases, with a few exceptions.

R code chunks can be defined like so:

```
'''{r, echo = TRUE}
# Code chunks can be explicitly included
'''

'''{r, echo = FALSE}

# Code chunks are hidden by default 
'''
```
Pages and columns within pages can be defined like so:

```
Page
=========================================   

Column {data-width=500}
-------------------------------------

Column {data-width=500}
-------------------------------------
```

### **6)** Add content to the pages and columns.

Plots and other elements can be added within columns like so:
```
### Plot name

'''{r}
# include plot code here
'''
```
Value Boxes, which are essentially text boxes can be defined like so:

```
### ValueBoxText

'''{r}
valueBox(value = 10
  color = "white")

'''
```

### Additional Info
As mentioned before, the `flexdashboard` metadata included in the `YAML` also alters how R Markdown documents are rendered.

<div class = "blue">

Here is a list of potential warning signs that can signal an individual may be in crisis and/or need help:

+ Suddenly withdrawing from people and activities
+ Consistent bullying or intimidating others, or being bullied by others
+ Extreme mood or personality changes
+ Victim of constant social rejection
+ Talking about plans or actively making plans to harm themselves or others
+ Bringing a weapon to school – or threatening or talking about doing so
+ Bragging about or warning others about an upcoming act of violence
+ Recruiting others to join in a planned act of violence
+ Warning students to stay away from school or events
+ Expressing fascination with guns and/or school shootings
+ Expressing hopelessness about the future
+ Extreme, prolonged sadness or distress
+ Expressing or showing feelings of isolation
+ Bragging about access to guns

**NOTE**

This list is not a comprehensive list of warning signs nor does exhibiting one of these signs indicate imminent violence.

When concerned about seeing troubling behaviors, tell a trusted adult or call 911, if there is an immediate threat.
